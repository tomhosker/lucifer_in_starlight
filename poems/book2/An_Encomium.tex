\settowidth{\versewidth}{His preaching brings to mind those fearsome creatures,}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\textsc{Rome} had her Caesars; Brandenburg, \textit{Old Fritz};\blfootnote{Friedrich II, King of Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg (known to we English as ``Frederick the Great'') was nicknamed ``Der Alte Fritz'' by his people, i.e. Old Fritz.}\\*
\vin Now \textsc{Mary's Church} can claim as lord \& master\\
The crimson-haired clergyman we love to bits,\\
\vin Our shield \& broadsword, friend and pastor;\\
\vin And should some peril loom, or grave disaster,\\
The parish wardens need no goads nor whips;\\*
He's all over it like a fat girl on chips.\\!

His preaching brings to mind those fearsome creatures,\\*
\vin \textit{Jan Sobieski} and the Prussian Duke.\blfootnote{Jan III, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania was named ``Saviour of Christendom'' by the Pope for lifting the siege of Vienna. Albert, Duke of Prussia was the first Protestant head of state.}\\
His writings rank beside the best-loved teachers':\\
\vin \textit{Paul of Tarsus} who -- now please don't puke --\\
\vin Might have had a soft spot for St \textit{Luke},\\
\textit{John Divine} to whose strange works men soften\\*
Once they're told he snorted coke quite often.\\!

Should your parish lack a priest or vicar\\*
\vin And ours go southward in a puff of smoke,\\
I'd recommend you fill the absence quicker\\
\vin Than a scot spends coin or gets a joke.\\
\vin With whom? The ginger \textit{Spurgeon}, God's best bloke:\\
Better than bovril, sturdier than a stetson,\\*
The incomparable Rev \textit{Chris Betson}.
\end{verse}
