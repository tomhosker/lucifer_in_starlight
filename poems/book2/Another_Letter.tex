    That you are, in your way, one of my daughters\blfootnote{The Greek pharoah Ptolemy VIII (he was nicknamed Physcon or ``the Sausage'' on account of his obesity) was surely one of the most wicked and repulsive men ever to have lived. He seduced and later married a girl who had the dubious distinction of being both his niece and his stepdaughter, and later murdered his own son and sent the corpse, piece by piece, to the boy's mother, who was also another of his wives and the mother of the aforementioned niece-stepdaughter-wife. Yet the poet finds something compelling, and, indeed, quite human in this supremely cruel and lustful individual.}\blfootnote{Quetzalcoatl was an Aztec deity who appeared at various times as a rattlesnake, a crow, the planet Venus and a duck.}\\*
    \vin Means I can forgive you your prattle.\\
    You've a rosebud like music over the waters\poeticmarginnote{Byron}\\
    \vin And more shapes than \textit{Quetzalcoatl}.\\
    \vin \vin \textit{Satan} called, the Devil sent me:\\
    \vin \vin \vin A horse is led\\
    \vin \vin \vin But never made to dip his head:\\*
    \vin \vin When the cat's away the mice do plenty.\\!

    It's no good this outliving \textit{Buddy Holly},\\*
    \vin Growing bald of brow \& round of gut;\\
    No more trips to \textsc{Wakefield} on a jolly\\
    \vin With \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} lb of coke \& some old slut,\\
    \vin \vin No more younger sisters' teenage friends.\\
    \vin \vin \vin But in your eyes\\
    \vin \vin \vin I see where resurrection lies,\\*
    \vin \vin And how it comes to pass and where it ends.\\!

    There's time enough to consider eternity.\\*
    \vin Put hell on the back burner; heaven can wait.\\
    The love of God and my children's paternity\\
    \vin Are truths too dearly-held to abrogate.\\
    \vin \vin For now, forever, my appetite\\
    \vin \vin \vin Is fixed on thighs,\\
    \vin \vin \vin Waists, fingers, heartbeats, cheeks \& eyes,\\*
    \vin \vin Those lips, both wrapped in cloth \& in plain\\*
    \vin \vin \vin \vin sight.
\end{verse}
