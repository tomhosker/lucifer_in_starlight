\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    I think of you more often than I'd choose to --\\*
    At home, at friends', in meetings, in the car --\\
    As if a stranger's heart could mend your fortunes,\\
    Or put things back to how they might have been.\\
    The mind blanks in the glare of so much horror,\poeticmarginnote{Larkin}\\
    And fails to grasp the stringency of death:\\
    You never lived to see your 16th birthday;\poeticmarginnote{\textit{Interview with a Vampire}, Claudia}\\
    He wouldn't let you grow to your full height.\\
    \textit{Japhthah}'s penknife pricks his daughter's waistband,\\
    And keeps his twisted vow:\poeticmarginnote{Jdg 11} you never knew\\
    The dull warmth of your first sips of brandy,\\*
    Or lay down holding your first lover's hand.\\!

    In a way, I envy that he killed you\\*
    In your sleep; and, since the papers allotted you\\
    So few words, I can picture you how I like:\poeticmarginnote{Καβάφης}\\
    Shy, capable of deep feeling,\\
    Not so delectable you'd never have to learn\\
    To delight the heart as well as the hands.\\
    I see us meeting at a hotel bar: you\\
    Had weathered the slug \& the flames, have flowered\\
    Into the woman you promised to become.\\
    And in all the hours we talk you only tell me\\
    The one thing I needed to be told:\\
    For all the pain \& hopelessness of living,\\*
    It is better to be alive.
\end{verse}
