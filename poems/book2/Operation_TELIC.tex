\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    I wake, earlier than I would like, while the day\\*
    Still lies in darkness -- this dark december,\\
    This snowless, christmasless mid-winter.\\
    I work down at the base: purchasing, planning --\\
    Tidal atlases, spreadsheets \& tables\\
    Of figures -- declarations \& forms\\
    To be filled in, signatures gleaned -- meetings\\
    Sat through \& stared through \& endured. Then\\
    I drive back down the same slick sodium-lit roads\\
    Towards a house unheated \& unknown.\\
    I drive \& drive but cannot help my dreaming:\\
    Those febrile bodies, precious as us to themselves,\poeticmarginnote{Auden}\\
    Cities \& villages, 40 million souls. But death\\
    Plants his boot-heels in the footsteps of \textit{Abraham}.\\*
    Death tightens his cowl in the shadow of the ziggurats.\\!

    The same stars are burning overhead\\*
    As \textit{Algazel} plotted in the House of Wisdom,\\
    The selfsame lustrous moon -- although\\
    Death sips his wine from skulls of Al Anfal.\\
    Death washes his swords in the waters of the \textsc{Tigris}.\poeticmarginnote{Sargon}\\
    The axeman stands at the root of the oak.\poeticmarginnote{Mt 3.10 \& al}\\
    Blood to be shed cries out from the ground -- and yet\\
    The skies are silent. Time alone will tell\\*
    Who was right and if it was all worth it.
\end{verse}

\blfootnote{Operation TELIC was the United Kingdom's contribution to the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. The operation was planned over the preceding Christmas, so that the planners joked bitterly that TELIC stood for ``Tell Everyone Leave Is Cancelled''. The poet imagines himself as one of the more lugubrious of said planners.}
