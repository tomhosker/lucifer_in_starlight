\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Who says that only dirges \& dark storms\\*
Make a good verse?\poeticmarginnote{Herbert} My song's burden warms\\
Not to the worst but to the best of themes:\\
The prince of PEARL, marquess of Microsoft Teams.\\
As sure as shale \& quicklime make cement,\\
The bards of years to come will thus lament:\\
`But no one living now is \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} as learn\`ed\\*
As \textit{Niels Bohr}, \textit{Max Planck} or \textit{David Bernhard}.'\\!

Where are \textsc{Z\"urich}'s gleaming hoards of riches?\\*
\vin Where are \textit{Heidi}'s hymns, which pierced the air?\poeticmarginnote{Spyri}\\
Where are \textit{Euler}'s shrewdness or his bridges?\poeticmarginnote{KÃ¶nigsberg}\\
\vin Give me the doctor with the flowing hair:\\
H\'is cool alpine charms would leave me sweatier\\*
Than all the other heartthrobs of Helvetia.
\end{verse}
