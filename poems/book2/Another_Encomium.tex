\settowidth{\versewidth}{His cool alpine charms would leave me sweatier}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Who says only dirges \& dark storms\\*
Make a good verse? My song's burden warms\\
Not to the worst but to the best of themes:\\
The prince of PEARL, marquess of Microsoft Teams.\\
As sure as shale \& quicklime make cement,\\
The bards of years to come will thus lament:\\
`But no one living now is \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} as learn\`ed\\*
As \textit{Niels Bohr}, \textit{Max Planck} or \textit{David Bernhard}.'\\!

Where is \textit{William Tell}, that bane of lords?\\*
\vin Where are \textit{Heidi}'s hymns, which pierced the air?\\
Where are \textit{Euler's} bridges or his chords?\\
\vin Give me the doctor with the flowing hair:\\
His cool alpine charms would leave me sweatier\\*
Than all those other scions of Helvetia.
\end{verse}
