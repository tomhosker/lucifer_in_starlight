\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
When I came to see you last october\\*
It felt like it was still summer. We drank\\
Warm guinness in a pub in \textsc{Holly Bank}.\\
You talked about growing old, the {\hoskeroe Advocate},\\
That year's lachrymose undergraduate,\\*
How you'd gentle \& disrobe her.\\!

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Later, we finished our drinks and \textit{Bernie}\\*
Drove us back into town. The rosy streetlights\\
Recalled lost prep school days \& winter nights\\
Beneath a restless wood; and all the while\\
Your lapis blue big eyes \& \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} a smile,\\*
Like some \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} sweet lines of \textit{Ivor Gurney}.\\!

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\it Earth, receive these ashes for safekeeping,\\*
And him, like the \textsc{Black Lyne} flowing:\\
Always running downstream but never going,\\
With strakes \& siltbanks \& silver overlaid,\\
The handsomest of all beds ever made\\*
For man or beast, but not for sleeping.
\end{verse}
