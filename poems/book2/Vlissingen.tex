\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
It was in an old dutch seaport,\\*
\vin Pocked with dieso and caul,\\
And five loaves \& two fishes\\*
\vin One side of a warehouse wall.\\!

In late september\\*
\vin And summer going,\\
The waves past the breakwater\\*
\vin To-ing \& fro-ing.\\!

The railings rusted,\\*
\vin Weathervanes weathered away.\\
O my love, my fair one,\poeticmarginnote{ER}\\*
\vin I wish I could stay.
\end{verse}
