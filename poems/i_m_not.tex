\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I'm not used to sleeping with someone else.\\*
\vin I lie a \sfrac{$1$}{$3$} asleep holding you stirring --\marginnote{\footnotesize DM\\ Christmas\\ Eve Morning}\\
A hand round your heart, the prickle of your \emph{mons}.\\
\vin All this morning I've been thinking about\\
That tender morsel of lukewarmth,\\*
\vin While the moon \& the stars wear themselves out.\\!

The snow is quietly silting up the glasswork\\*
\vin When you open your eyes and paw my palm.\\
The flesh of your neck is like opened fruit,\\
\vin And your arms around my waist hurt.\\
Here is your tongue, and here is your navel;\\*
\vin These are your hands \& this is your side.\\!

I remember the first real girlfriend I had,\marginnote{\footnotesize HR}\\*
\vin Blue eyes \& a scholar's stammer.\\
She was an atheist; she was the only girl\\
\vin I ever knew who slept more deeply than me.\\
I used to hold her, of a wintertime, and\\*
\vin Trace the sign of the cross on her brow.
\end{verse}
