\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
She's only nine tenths beautiful,\poeticmarginnote{Blind Girl on a Train}\\*
\vin And yet we men are standing reverently around,\\
\vin \vin Watching her listening\\*
To her tapes, and sometimes smile, belle of Coach F.\\!

Her hair is tangled \& black, like black-bryony,\\*
\vin Ringletting down to her seat, beneath which\\
\vin \vin A violin case\\*
Edged with red velvet is tucked between her calves.\\!

And those cheeks, as tender as meltwater\\*
\vin And as clear, that small voice purling\\
\vin \vin More rosily than mulled wine,\\*
That six hand\poeticmarginnote{hand = 4 in} waist no soul has yet handled.\\!

But the light fails, lovers meet and journeys end.\marginnote{\footnotesize Shak}\\*
\vin She alights, to be met by her first sweetheart,\\
\vin \vin Whose head she kisses\\*
As if the world, and not her, had gone blind:\\!

And nothing matters more than a girl,\\*
\vin Of a velvety, late august early evening,\\
\vin \vin With her fingers\\*
In the lapels of her lover's jacket.
