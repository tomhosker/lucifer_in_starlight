\settowidth{\versewidth}{Where as a younger man I'd man spent one summer.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\textsc{Bridgetown}, a night in a gale with a girl,\poeticmarginnote{Ginsberg ``Dream Record''~| ES}\\*
The doctor I met on board, talking over\\
Old lost lovers and {\hoskeroe The Last Picture Show}\\
With cold beef \& chocolates \& a rough scotch.\\
Darkness. I lay in her bunk\\
And travelled in dreams back to a garden in \textsc{Rome}\\
Where as a younger man I'd man spent one summer.\\
You \& \textit{Alex} were behind the bar. It was freezing,\poeticmarginnote{RR}\\*
And the snow fell through the rich blackness into our drinks.\\!

Ah there you were, \textit{Isla}, with those curious clear blue eyes\\*
And tangled soft brown hair like a river of living bronze.\\
The time between us is nothing at all,\\*
Nor death and the river of forgetfulness.
\end{verse}
