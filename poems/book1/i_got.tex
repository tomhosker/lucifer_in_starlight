\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I got this knife off an arab trader\poeticmarginnote{Kavadias \guillemotleft{Ένα Μαχαίρι}\guillemotright}\\*
In odds \& ends in a stall in \textsc{Algiers}.\\
I remember his hoarse voice and hollow stare,\\*
The grime staining his lips \& fingers.\\!

See that mark there. That's hand-worked sheffield steel.\nobreak\\*
Those are real rubies set into the hilt.\\
But every man who ever held its weight\\*
Ended up killing someone that he loved.\\!

A father who walked in on his young wife\\*
With his own son gutted him in the street.\\
A greek sailor sawed through his boatswain's windpipe\\*
Over a bad hand \& a packet of smokes.\\!

I keep this knife tucked into my work-belt,\\*
Where the sunlight catches those wine-dark stones.\\
And I, that care for no one in this world,\\*
Am terrified I'll only turn it on myself.
