\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I got this knife off an arab trader\poeticmarginnote{Kavadias, \guillemotleft{Ένα Μαχαίρι}\guillemotright}\\*
\vin In odds \& ends in a stall in \textsc{Algiers}.\\
I remember his hoarse voice \& hollow stare,\\*
\vin The grime staining his lips \& fingers.\\!

See that mark there. That's hand-worked sheffield steel.\\*
\vin Those are real rubies set into the hilt.\\
But every man who ever held its weight\\*
\vin Ended up killing someone that he loved.\\!

A father who walked in on his young wife\\*
\vin With his own son gutted him in the street.\\
A greek sailor sawed through his boatswain's windpipe\\*
\vin Over a bad hand \& a packet of smokes.\\!

I keep this knife tucked into my work belt,\\*
\vin Where the sunlight catches those wine-dark stones.\poeticmarginnote{Homer}\\
And I, that care for no one in this world,\\*
\vin Am terrified I'll only turn it on myself.
