\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Afterwards, we drove back to the hotel,\poeticmarginnote{ES}\\*
\vin The lights in the dockyard just coming on\\
And the sun bedding down under the causeway.\poeticmarginnote{Chiswell Beach}\\
\vin The night was heavy with rain and you fell asleep\\*
To something by Snow Patrol or Radio 4.\\!

You blessed the meal when we sat down to supper,\\*
\vin And after, with your hands around the cup.\poeticmarginnote{hic est enim sanguis meus}\\
In the room, we kissed \& drank old fashioneds,\\
\vin Watched the first \poeticfrac{1}{2} an hour of {\hoskeroe Heartbreak Ridge};\\*
Then you pulled off your teeshirt with the chinese prints.\\!

I could never admit that I liked it: but\\*
\vin The light from the lampstand gentling your body,\\
A touch of bois des \^iles behind each ear,\\
\vin You laying yourself back on the duvet like\\
You were a teenager and this was the first time.
\end{verse}
