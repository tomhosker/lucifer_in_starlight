\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The tide turns in the river, day becomes dusk,\poeticmarginnote{\textit{In Praise of Older Women}, Julika, `after Christmas'}\\*
\vin And you, as shy as a fox (or\\
My own heart), steal in\\
\vin In your mother's red silk nightdress,\\
Fringed with fur \& a hem of white satin --\\*
\vin A quaint match for your 15 years.\\!

Fire is not quenched by the dark, but\poeticmarginnote{Auden}\\*
\vin Love, sometimes, is blunted by fear:\\
You have untied the cord from your waist,\\
\vin Laid your treasures out on the covers,\\
But, for all my teenage desire, I\\*
\vin Could not make myself hard for you.\\!

You pressed your face against me when we kissed,\\*
\vin After, I remember, and my head swam --\\
`Young girls should show their nightgowns\\
\vin To men worthy of the name' --\\
The branches blackened \& bare in the courtyard\\*
\vin Because they could not be otherwise.
\end{verse}
