\begin{verse}[0.96\textwidth]
A ghost is something -- death does not close all --\poeticmarginnote{Propertius IV.7~| Prof Lee~| Leopardi}\\*
\vin And a soul seeps out, untied from its body --\\
For I have seen \textit{Silvia} peering over my bedhead\\
\vin Though we'd buried her ashes by the side of the parkway\\
Only that day -- as if she'd been fished out of the fire\\*
\vin And the waters of \textsc{Lethe} had not yet worn away her lips.\\!

`How can you?' she said. `How can you sleep?\\*
\vin Aren't you forgetting those nights we shared together:\nobreak\\
The zip of my sundress, worn down from overuse,\\
\vin And the scent of rose oil mingled with cigarette smoke?\\
We often made love under the railbridge,\\
\vin Our bodies warming the bare earth.\\
Alas for all those pleasures of sweet life\\*
\vin Which time \& heartache blindly poured away.\\!

`But I'll say no more about that. Water under the bridge.\nobreak\\*
\vin You paid me your respects in what you wr\'ote.\\
If you still want to make amends: bury your notebooks next to my grave,\\
\vin Plant myrtle over us both, and carve in the limestone\\
Where \textsc{Anio}'s purling fattens \textit{Caesar}'s plum groves\\
\vin And ivory, thanks to \textit{Hercules}, never yellows:\\
\textit{Here lies gold \& }Silvia\textit{, bringing}\\*
\vin \textit{Glory, Father \textsc{Anio}, to your banks.}\\!

`And pay attention to the entreaties of the departed.\\*
\vin If word gets back from the dead, it must be worth knowing.\\
Daylight keeps us in chains; night sets us free,\\
\vin And \textit{Cerberus} only watches the backs of his six eyelids.\nobreak\\
Others may hold you for now;\\
\vin You'll be ashes yourself soon enough.\\
You'll be with me,\poeticmarginnote{I Sam 28.19} and the good earth\\*
\vin Will mill each of our bones into the other's.'\\!

Thus she spoke, and laid herself beside me,\\*
\vin But when the morning came her warmth was gone.
