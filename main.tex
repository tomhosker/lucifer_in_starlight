\chapter*{A Love-Letter}

\begin{center}
    \textit{from the mariner Ulysses}\\
    \textit{to his beloved lady-physician}\poeticmarginnote{ES}
\end{center}

\bigskip

\settowidth{\versewidth}{Like mine can bear and still stay whole.}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    That you're still, in a sense, a virgin,\\*
    Drink like \textit{George Best} and speak like \textit{Charles Spurgeon}\\
    Are all the grounds for love a soul\\
    Like mine can bear and still stay whole.\\
    Two wretched things have kept me up of late,\\
    Which bruise an honest seaman's trust in fate:\\
    The young \& winsome aged, or killed by traffic;\\*
    A girl like you beguiled by all things sapphic.\\!

    Alas, I'm more like \textit{Mars} than \textit{Venus},\\*
    But does that have to come between us?\\
    I'm told I'm gifted with my fingers,\\
    And, though I've not tried cunnalingus,\\
    You're welcome to compare my lips\\
    To any temptress' tastebud-tips,\\
    And summon cries of joy, not laughter.\\*
    (I'd even like to cuddle after.)\\!

    Although I cannot make my chest hair\\*
    Go, and put a plump round breast there,\\
    Nor bid my size 10 feet farewell,\\
    The same goes for my love as well.\\
    Salt-laced hearts do not find in rejection\\
    Grounds for loss of ardour or dejection.\\
    Time will only say, I told you so;\poeticmarginnote{Auden}\\
    And yet it suits me more than you know\\*
    To play \textit{Tiresias} to your virago.
\end{verse}


\chapter*{Another Letter}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
    That you are, in your way, one of my daughters\blfootnote{The Greek pharoah Ptolemy VIII (he was nicknamed Physcon or ``the Sausage'' on account of his obesity) was surely one of the most wicked and repulsive men ever to have lived. He seduced and later married a girl who had the dubious distinction of being both his niece and his stepdaughter, and later murdered his own son and sent the corpse, piece by piece, to the boy's mother, who was also another of his wives and the mother of the aforementioned niece-stepdaughter-wife. Yet the poet finds something compelling, and, indeed, quite human in this supremely cruel and lustful individual.}\blfootnote{Quetzalcoatl was an Aztec deity who appeared at various times as a rattlesnake, a crow, the planet Venus and a duck.}\\*
    \vin Means that I can forgive you your prattle.\\
    You've a rosebud like music over the waters\poeticmarginnote{Byron}\\
    \vin And more shapes than \textit{Quetzalcoatl}.\\

    \vin \vin When the cat's away the mice do plenty.\\!

    It's no good this outliving \textit{Buddy Holly},\\*
    \vin Growing bald of brow \& round of gut;\\
    No more trips to \textsc{Wakefield} on a jolly\\
    \vin With \sfrac{$1$}{$2$} a lb of coke \& some old slut,\\
    \vin \vin No more younger sisters' teenage friends.\\
    \vin \vin \vin But in your eyes\\
    \vin \vin \vin I see where resurrection lies,\\*
    \vin \vin And how it comes to pass and where it ends.\\!

    There's time enough to consider eternity.\\*
    \vin Put hell on the back burner; heaven can wait.\\
    The love of God and my children's paternity\\
    \vin Are truths too dearly-held to abrogate.\\
    \vin \vin For now, forever, my appetite\\
    \vin \vin \vin Is fixed on thighs,\\
    \vin \vin \vin Waists, fingers, heartbeats, cheeks \& eyes,\\*
    \vin \vin Those lips, both wrapped in cloth and in plain\\*
    \vin \vin \vin \vin sight.

\vin Might have had a soft spot for St \textit{Luke},\\
\textit{John Divine} to whose strange works men soften\\*
Once they're told he snorted coke quite often.\\!

Should your parish lack a priest or vicar\\*
\vin And ours go southward in a puff of smoke,\\
I'd recommend you fill the absence quicker\\
\vin Than a scot spends coin or gets a joke.\\

    Death wipes his swords in the waters of the \textsc{Tigris}.\\

    The skies are silent. Time alone will tell\\*
    Who was right and if it was all worth it.
