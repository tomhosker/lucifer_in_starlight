\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I woke up between you \& your sister.\poeticmarginnote{FC}\\*
\vin (When you were kids you'd sleep in the same bunk,\\
So you say; now she's apt to feel jealous.)\\*
\vin All three had fallen asleep in our clothes.\\!

You knelt beside me and gave me my glasses.\\*
\vin Someone stirred and checked through his phone.\\
It was nighttime: a rich lampblack dark. In the hallway\\*
\vin Streetlights fondled through the fronds of a birch.\\!

\emph{David} himself would've run out of verses\\*
\vin In praise of that kiss, the deep scar at your waist.\\
In the dark, the heel of my hand found your breastbone,\\*
\vin Guessing its line by touch \& the mind's eye.\\!

Were it not for you I would've missed the snowstorm\\*
\vin Blanching the path down to the weir from the railbridge,\nobreak\\
The emptiness beyond the arbour,\\*
\vin \textsc{Neville}'\textsc{s Cross} and \textsc{Pity Me}.
\end{verse}
