\begin{verse}[0.99\textwidth]
    The soul is nothing; death truly blots out all;\poeticmarginnote{Propertius IV.7~| Prof Lee~| Leopardi}\\*
    \vin And the fire behind the eyes is lost forever.\\
    But I have seen \textit{Silvia} peering over my bedhead\\
    \vin Though we'd buried her ashes by the side of the road\\
    Only that day -- as if she'd been fished out of the fire\\*
    \vin And the river of death had not yet worn away her lips.\\!

    `How can you,' she said, `how can you sleep?\\*
    \vin Have you forgetten the nights we had together:\\
    The zip of my sundress, worn down from overuse,\\
    \vin And the scent of rose oil mingled with cigarette smoke?\\
    We often made love under the railbridge, our bodies\\
    \vin Warming the bare earth.\\
    So much for all those pleasures of sweet life\\*
    \vin Which time \& heartache blindly poured away.\\!

    `But I'll say no more about that. Water under the bridge.\\*
    \vin You paid me your respects in what you wr\'ote.\\
    If you still want to make things right: bury those notebooks next to my grave,\\
    \vin Plant myrtle over us both, and score in the limestone --\\
    Where \textsc{Anio}'s purling fattens thirsty plum groves,\\
    \vin And ivory, thanks to \textit{Hercules}, never yellows --\\
    \textit{Here lies gold \& }Silvia\textit{, bringing}\\*
    \vin \textit{Glory, Father \textsc{Anio}, to your banks.}\\!

    `And pay attention to the words of your old call girl;\\*
    \vin Dreams of the dead are worth you keeping in mind.\\
    Daylight keeps us in chains; night sets us free,\\
    \vin And \textit{Cerberus} only watches the backs of his six eyelids.\\
    Others can have you for now;\\
    \vin You'll be ashes yourself soon enough.\\
    You'll be with me,\poeticmarginnote{I Sam 28.19} and the good earth\\*
    \vin Will mill each of our bones into the other's.'\\!

    That was all. Then she lay down beside me,\\*
    \vin But when the morning came her weight was gone.
