\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
The orgy at \textsc{Earls Crescent}\\*
\vin Was not as I had hoped,\\
Nor making love as pleasant\\*
\vin As when we first eloped.\\!

\textit{Rosie} \& her cider\poeticmarginnote{Laurie Lee}\\*
\vin Once went straight to my head,\\
But now her quim's much wider\\*
\vin And \textit{Peaches Geldof}'s dead.\\!

The threesome with your sister\\*
\vin Was not so sweet a sin\\
As drunken late-night Twister\poeticmarginnote{i.e. the game}\\*
\vin On the school trip to \textsc{King's Lynn}.
\end{verse}
