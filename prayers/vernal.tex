A cup of wine was offered me,\marginnote{\includegraphics[width=12mm]{images/solomon}} and I drank it in the sweetness of my delight in you. My feet have found their furrow, my mouth its bridle. The lover has found his beloved, and Jack has his Jill. A cup of wine was offered me, because your vines were heavy with the riches therein; because whoever dips his lip into this cup tastes life itself, and whoever drinks even a mouthful becomes immortal; and if the whole world perished, I would not. I will live by the wine of this cup forever. Alleluia.
