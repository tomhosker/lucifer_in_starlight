\poeticmarginnote{\textarabic{محمد}}God, I am your possession, the son of your workman, the son of your washerwoman, and you hold my head in your hands. All your wishes for me are just, and your wishes are always carried out. I ask you, by every name with which you have named yourself, or which you have taught to any of your creatures, or which you have revealed in your book, or which you have kept within yourself in your knowledge of the unseen: make your book into the knocking of my heart and the brightness of my eyes, and a departure for my sorrow and a release from all distress. Amen.
