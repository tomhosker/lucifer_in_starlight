\poeticmarginnote{Μανασσῆς}God, who in former times heard the petitions of ordinary creatures, take pity on me, and have mercy on the work of your hands. My crimes are so hateful that I have lost the right even to look up and enjoy the sky: the warmth of the sun, and the gentler splendour of the heavens. They weigh me down like a yoke of solid iron, and cling to me like a spiteful shadow. My punishment is more than I can bear; forgive me, Lord. Help me to bend the knee of my heart, and tune my heart strings to your music. Amen.
